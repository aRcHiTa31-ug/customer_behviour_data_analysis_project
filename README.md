# customer_behviour_data_analysis_project
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing data using Python (Pandas and NumPy), storing the cleaned data in a MySQL database, and analyzing it using SQL queries. The data is then connected to Power BI through ODBC to create interactive dashboards and visualizations for meaningful insights and decision-making.

## Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Customer Insights

📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics pipeline, from raw data ingestion to executive-level presentation. By combining Python for data processing, SQL for deep-dive querying, and Power BI for visualization, this project uncovers actionable insights to drive business decisions.

📊 Dataset
Source: File available in repo

🛠 Tools Used
Python (Pandas/cryptography/mtsql-connector-python): Initial data loading, cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
SQL (MySQL): Complex data manipulation and business-logic querying.
Power BI: Interactive dashboarding and reporting.

🚀 Steps & Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & EDA (Python)
Handled missing values and outliers.
Performed univariate and multivariate analysis to identify trends and correlations.
Standardized data formats for seamless SQL integration.
2. Database Management (SQL)
Imported cleaned data into a relational database.
Wrote optimized queries to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as [e.g., Retention Rate, CLV, or Monthly Growth].
3. Data Visualization (Power BI)
Built a multi-page interactive dashboard.
Implemented DAX measures for dynamic time-intelligence reporting.
Focused on UI/UX to ensure clear communication of insights.
